<p>The use of technology in the hospitality industry has grown exponentially over the past decade. Most restaurants and
    hotels not only accept credit card payments, but also use software to manage reservations, payroll, supply chain
    management, and sales among many other things. Most hospitality companies offer wifi. Hotels have begun hosting
    smart TVs and biometric technology. With an increase in devices comes an increase in vectors for cyberattack.
    The hospitality industry has been a popular target for cybercriminals. Hospitality businesses see high turnover
    rate: they are constantly seeing new customers, and thereby receiving high quantities of sensitive data. In India,
    for example, attacks on the food industry made up nearly 25% of cyber attacks in 2019 (Kumar, 2017). While major
    hotel chains, such as Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, and many others have been victims of cyberattack, small businesses
    are likewise affected by hackers.<br> <br>
    While over 50% of small business owners have no plan in place to respond to cyber attacks, nearly 49% of all data
    breaches in 2019 were from small businesses (Rosenbaum, 2021). As the owner of a restaurant or hotel with minimal
    resources, tackling the issue of cybersecurity can be daunting.<br> <br>
    The consequences of cyberattacks, however, whether from data breaches or ransomware attacks can be devastating for
    your business. This article will aim to make developing cybersecurity procedures easier for you by examining common
    points of attack, how faulty procedures have led to attacks in the past, and by listing ways to improve security
    practices, many of which are free.</p>

<br>
<h3>Phishing</h3>
<p>
    The most popular vector of attack is through phishing emails. A 2019 report on data breaches claimed that early 90%
    of data breaches against the hospitality industry came in the form of phishing attacks (Verizon, 2019). In a study
    on the cybersecurity practices of Las Vegas hotels, front desk employees reported that they regularly received
    phishing emails in both their main inboxes and spam (Shabani, 2017). POS attacks against Pennsylvania based company
    Wawa and Checkers resulted from malware planted through phishing attacks (Everett, 2020). Over 2,000 credit card
    records were stolen by a phishing attack against a small hotel in Maine. The hacker(s) pretended to be a guest and
    installed malware on the internal system (Fishell, 2015). Phishing attacks not only install malware, but target
    businesses directly as well. Malicious actors will often send emails pretending to be suppliers and direct wire
    transfers to their own accounts rather than vendors (Tripwire, 2021). <br><br> General information about phishing
    attacks can
    be found <a href="https://www.vadesecure.com/en/blog/phishing-awareness-training-8-things-employees-understand">here</a>
    Larger companies may want to invest in comprehensive employee training to protect against phishing attacks. For
    larger
    business, <a
        href="https://expertinsights.com/insights/the-top-11-phishing-awareness-training-and-simulation-solutions/">Expert
    Insights</a>
    offers a list of resources to help train employees against phishing.
    For small businesses, affording this kind of training can be difficult. A few basic things that can be done to
    prevent against phishing attacks are:
</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Train employees to never use POS systems for anything other than work (i.e. browsing the internet, checking
        personal emails, etc.). Opening emails and links from the same system used to handle credit card transactions
        makes it much easier for hackers to access sensitive information.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Check email addresses. Often hackers will try to make emails look authentic by mimicking popular domain names,
        i.e. @am0zon.com. Verify that email addresses are from known users before clicking any links
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Download an anti-phishing toolbar. This easy to use tool can be downloaded as an extension on your web browser,
        and automatically searches for suspicious emails and links
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Education: continue to educate yourself and your staff about phishing attacks
    </li>
    <br>
</ul>
<br>
<p>While employing these methods will not prevent phishing attacks entirely, establishing good practices can make it
    much harder for your business to become susceptible to phishing attacks.

<h3>POS Systems</h3>
<p>One of the most common ways hospitality companies are attacked is by targeting POS systems (Klein, 2019). Attacks
    against POS systems are particularly damaging because they directly expose sensitive customer information, which not
    only hurts your clients but may cause them to lose trust in your business. Ways to enhance the security of your POS
    systems include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check POS systems for any unfamiliar devices (i.e. flash drives) which may be connected
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Use chip readers as opposed to magnetic stripe readers. EMV chips greatly improve security and make it
        significantly more expensive for hackers to access credit card information. An example of the benefit of chip
        readers can be shown through the 2015 Mandarin Oritenal malware attack. Mandarin Oriental hotels were infected
        with malware which targeted magnetic stripe credit card payments. Cards which used EMV were not affected by the
        attack (Kitten, 2015). Additionally, asking for debit PINs can add yet another layer of security on credit card
        payment systems.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Ensure that POS systems are running on up-to-date operating systems. If a POS is running on an operating system
        with known vulnerabilities, it can be much easier for hackers to install malware and gain access to the system.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Check POS systems for skimming devices. Skimming devices can be damaging to businesses, and regularly checking
        can be a good way of ensure hackers cannot maintain access to your systems (Bank of America). A guide to
        checking devices can be found <a
                href="https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/whos-checking-your-point-of-sale-pos-system-for-skimming">here</a>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Ensure that systems are <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">PCI compliant.</a> Only ~40% of
        businesses worldwide are PCI compliant (Kumar, 2017). Ensuring PCI compliance makes it significantly more costly
        for hackers to compromise your system.
    </li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Wifi</h3>
<p>Another popular vector of attack is through public wifi systems. If your businesses’ private servers and database are
    accessed by the same wifi that is available to the public, your sensitive data can be accessed virtually over that
    network (Suter, 2018). Additionally, when POS systems are not isolated over a network, hackers can more easily
    access those systems virtually over the same network (Klein, 2019).
    <br><br>
    The best solution would be to use entirely different wifi networks for internal operations and for public usage. If
    multiple networks are not available,
    <a href="https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/micro-segmentation">micro-segmentation</a> is also a good means of ensuring that attackers
    even if hackers do gain access to your system, they are not easily able to horizontally move across the system. Good
    practices for wifi implementation include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Having separate wifi networks in order to isolate critical infrastructure (i.e. POS systems)
    </li><br>
    <li>Micro-segmentation or other software to manage different components of the network
    </li><br>
    <li>Encourage guests to use VPNs to ensure their own protection
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Password protects your wifi network. Passwords can still be given out to guests, but adding a password to the network greatly reduces public access
    </li><br>
    <li>When possible, create user credentials for wifi access. Hotels, for example, can allow guests to gain access to wifi through temporary credentials. This vastly improves the security of the network
    </li><br></li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Physical Attacks</h3>
<p>It is also important for hospitality companies to be wary of physical attacks. The nature of the hospitality industry dictates that employees will be trusted with sensitive client information. One way to mitigate the risk of physical attacks is to create unique user profiles for employees. That way, for example, if an employee is stealing credit card information, it would be relatively easy to determine that all of the stolen credit cards were processed by that employee. In this way, cybersecurity systems prevent against physical attacks against your establishment.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Other Good Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Asking loyalty members to frequently change their passwords. Hotels often store information about their loyalty customers for long periods of time (Stevens, 2021). Data breaches can be especially damaging because they may seriously disrupt the loyal customer base of an establishment. Frequently changing passwords is a simply way to help keep customer information secure. Similarly:
    </li><br>
    <li>Sending frequent emails regarding account activity is a good way to be quickly alerted when fraudulent activity occurs
    </li><br>
    <li>Requiring the usage of complex passwords. Not only should customers use complex passwords, but it is important that staff members are required to use complex passwords when accessing sensitive information such as payroll
    </li><br>
    <li>Use token authentication when booking rather than storing raw data can improve the safety of reservations (Stevens, 2021)
    </li><br>
    <li>Do not store sensitive information in plain text</li><br>
    <li>Regularly check for updates and plan for updates. It is important to keep all systems up to date, as failing to update may result in your system containing known vulnerabilities and make you susceptible to attacks
    </li><br>
    <li>Manage 3rd party libraries. Most hospitality companies will use 3rd-party libraries to manage systems such as payroll or online payment. All 3rd party libraries used by your system should be logged, checked for compliance, and regularly updated
    </li><br>
    <li>Purchase insurance against cyberattacks. Purchasing insurance not only covers your liability in the event of a cyber attack, but it also may allow you access to top cybersecurity firms in the event of a data breach (Jacobs, 2020)
    </li><br>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, plan for cyberattacks. Hopefully your business will not fall victim to a cyberattack, however, as the usage of technology continues to increase in the hospitality sector, and as businesses are forced to integrate that new technology in order to keep up, cyber attacks become more and more likely. Create a plan to follow in order to respond to a cyber threat so that your business is prepared if the worst should happen.
